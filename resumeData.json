    "bio":"I'm not sure exactly why I got into CS to begin with--it was probably because I joined my high school's VeX Robotics team when I was a freshman and stuck with it. The most interesting part of programming for me is using it as a tool to enable creativity in other fields, from engineering to musical composition. I am currently working at a machine learning startup called Uptime solutions where we are using machine learning to predict when manufacturing machines are going to break. This summer I will be interning as a software engineer at Microsoft.",
